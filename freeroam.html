      <h2>About free roam games</h2>
      <p>An open world is a level or game designed to be  nonlinear, open areas/settings with many different paths ways to reach an objective.
       Some games have both both traditional and open-world levels.
       An open world has greater exploration opposed to a series of smaller levels, or a level with more linear challenges.
       Reviewers have judged the quality of an open world based on whether there are interesting ways for the player to interact with the game when they ignore their main objective.
       it isnt uncommon to see settings model an open world, such as New York City or germany.</p>
