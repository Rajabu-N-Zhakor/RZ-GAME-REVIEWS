      <h3>Call Of Duty</h3>
     <p>Call of Duty: World War II has, in many ways, been exactly the game the franchise needed after five years of increasingly futuristic entries with crazy movement schemes and over-the-top sci-fi elements. It's still very much in the mold of Call of Duty since Modern Warfare, but it's a refreshing return to gravity-based gameplay nonetheless.
Minor spoilers follow in this discussion of the game's single-player campaign.Many people criticize Call of Duty for even  having a campaign these days. Isn't it all about the multiplayer and the zombies? Most players won't even finish the campaign, in spite of its fairly short length. So why even bother?
I never much cared for that line of thinking. I always start with the campaign, and even though I'm almost always left wishing that Activision and its three CoD studios would do more with this mode, I also always enjoy myself. I don't even touch multiplayer until I've finished, or at least mostly finished, the story. And since the campaign is usually pretty short, I get to have the satisfaction of playing through a full game without spending dozens of hours on it.
